# **Exploring Mental Health Data**

## **Project Overview**

In this project, we explore a synthetic dataset derived from a mental health survey. The primary objective is to predict whether individuals are likely to experience depression based on various features, such as demographics, lifestyle factors, and behavioral data. The project will involve thorough data analysis, building machine learning models, and generating predictions for depression.

### **Project Goal**

The main aim of this project is to predict the binary target variable `Depression`:

- `0`: No depression.
- `1`: Depression.

### **Key Tasks**

- **Data Exploration**: Gain insights into the dataset by performing an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.
- **Model Development**: Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict depression.
- **Prediction**: Use the trained models to predict depression based on the input features.

## **Dataset Description**

The dataset consists of several files:

- **train.csv**: Contains the training data, including input features and the target variable (`Depression`).
  
  **Note**: The dataset is synthetic, generated from a deep learning model trained on a real-world depression survey. While the dataset simulates realistic patterns, it’s important to consider this when interpreting results.

### **Features in the Dataset**

The dataset contains various features that might influence the likelihood of depression, such as:

- Demographic data (age, gender, etc.)
- Lifestyle factors (work pressure, sleep quality, etc.)
- Behavioral data (social media usage, daily habits, etc.)

## **Steps Involved**

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   - **Objective**: Understand the structure of the dataset and identify potential issues.
   - Key steps: 
     - Check for missing or inconsistent values.
     - Visualize feature distributions and correlations.
     - Identify potential outliers.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**

   - **Objective**: Clean and prepare the data for model training.
   - Key tasks:
     - Handle missing values (e.g., imputation or removal).
     - Encode categorical variables into numeric format.
     - Scale or normalize numerical features for better model performance.

### 3. **Model Building**

   - **Objective**: Train machine learning models to predict depression.
   - Possible models include:
     - **Logistic Regression**
     - **Random Forest**
     - **XGBoost**

### 4. **Model Evaluation**

   - **Objective**: Assess model performance using suitable evaluation metrics.
   - Key metrics:
     - **Accuracy**
     - **Precision**
     - **Recall**
     - **F1 Score**
     - **ROC-AUC** (for binary classification)

### Additional Notes:

- The **synthetic nature** of the dataset means that it may not represent all real-world complexities. However, it serves as a good starting point for understanding mental health prediction using machine learning.
- Future work could include **model deployment**, testing with real-world data, and **explainability** to ensure the models are interpretable.
